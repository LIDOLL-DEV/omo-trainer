# Little Log user checklist

On **Roll**, enable **Desperation mode** for half the final Pee chance and a 30-minute cooldown after Hold. For example, 50% becomes 25%. The choice is remembered on this device; turning it off restores normal odds and 15-minute Hold cooldowns for future rolls. It does not shorten an active timer. The Low/Med/High/Crisis slider remains a separate urgency rating.

Your device now stays signed in for 30 days, renewed while the app is used, with a fresh sign-in after at most six months. Keep using the same browser or installed app. **Sign out & clear device** still ends this device's session; use it on shared devices. After deployment, an already expired sign-in needs one final login to start the longer session.

## Administrator CrowPanel setup

- Deploy the tracker, then open **Admin console → Statistics devices** and create an **Everyone and individual views (admin)** token.
- Configure Wi-Fi, the tracker API address and that token in the sketch's private `config.h`; follow the adjacent README for the Advance 7-inch V1.4 build settings.
- Verify Everyone/Individual, Prev/Next and date windows against saved records. Revoke the device token when retiring the panel.

The statistics API is unavailable to ordinary participant accounts. Details: [STATISTICS_API.md](STATISTICS_API.md).

Little Log now appears as a recovered Chrysalis observation terminal. **Record archive** is your history view; **Settings & data** contains account and export controls. The old **CRT FX** button and its scanline texture have been removed, so the screen is always clear. On a phone, open the menu with **Menu** or by swiping right from the left edge of the screen; swipe left to close it.

- Open `/tracker/` in your browser. Optional: install it from your browser menu, or Safari's Share → Add to Home Screen.
- In Settings, sign in with your shared lidoll.dev account to connect this device. Connecting uploads existing entries and future changes; Chrysalis can use synced records for analysis.
- You can also choose **Sign in to sync** beside the save status at the top of any page. After signing in, **Connect device** opens Settings so you can review and approve uploading this device's entries. The header button disappears once this device is connected and signed in.
- If you need an account, choose **Create account**, enter a username and a password twice, then review the app's identity access. Back in the tracker, choose **Connect & upload my entries** when ready to sync your local records.
- Check the time and enter liquids consumed since your previous saved check-in in mL. Choose **Save liquids** to record it; the intake field then resets to zero.
- Choose the check-in diaper number. Select **Your position** in the roll card before rolling. In **Record a wetting**, classify one actual event; its diaper number is assigned automatically from records at the event time.
- Use **Record a diaper change** below the wetting form to save each change and the number of wettings that diaper received. Correct the suggestion for unlogged or overnight wettings; 0 records a dry change. The next diaper number is suggested after saving.
- The main protocol starts at 50% with your first saved record. Use **Roll** in its own card to draw using the daily chance. It saves the roll and its selected position, leaving your unfinished observation alone. A Hold pauses further rolls for fifteen minutes; **Save liquids** and wetting logging stay available.
- In **Record a wetting**, classify each actual event once as Forced, Semi-Forced (SF), Voluntary, Semi-involuntary, Involuntary, Bedwetting, or Used the potty, including events without a roll. Each save adds one classified event. The per-diaper total is recorded separately when changing it.
- Completed days with F + SF + V >= SI + I reduce the chance by 5 percentage points. Other days, including days with no F/SF/V/SI/I events recorded, increase it by 5 points. The chance stays between 20% and 80%. Open **About** in the navigation to read the protocol rules and review your daily adjustment history.
- Today affects tomorrow. Correcting a past wetting recalculates later days; recorded roll probabilities stay unchanged. Day boundaries use the timezone saved at enrollment, even on another device.
- Use your diaper whenever needed. The random result is optional and does not record a wetting automatically.
- Review Charts or History. Edit mistakes or delete individual records in History.
- Download JSON backups in Settings. Import restores new records without duplicating identical entries. CSV exports the current history selection for spreadsheets.
- Check the save status: offline changes wait on this device until it reconnects. Reopen the app and sign in again if the session expires. Use the same account on another device to retrieve your central history.
- If Settings reports a conflict, compare the device and server copies and explicitly choose which one to keep.
- Sign out & clear device removes this device's copy after ending Little Log's session. It preserves server records; export pending changes first. Shared sign-in can remain active for other lidoll.dev apps.
- Deleting entries while connected queues deletion from the central database and other devices. Older downloaded files or server backups may retain previous copies.

Diaper defaults reset when the selected local date changes, while unsaved intake stays in the form. Today's liquid summary adds interval amounts saved on that date. Older cumulative snapshots are counted once, with only later intervals added. If an interval spans midnight, its intake belongs to the check-in date. Historical timestamps retain their recorded local day and timezone offset.

Default position is device-specific; enrollment, wettings, diaper changes and check-in records sync. Sync before switching devices: an offline device cannot know about another device's pending records or cooldown. You can register yourself or use an account created by the lidoll.dev administrator. No email address is collected; contact the administrator for password resets.

During a server update, offline check-ins remain on the device and retry afterward. After a frontend update, close old Little Log tabs and reopen to let the new app version activate.


## Intake units

- [ ] Switch mL / US fl oz with a draft amount and confirm switching back preserves it.
- [ ] Enter decimal ounces, save, and verify history records the converted whole mL value.
- [ ] Reopen offline and confirm the unit preference remains selected and new intake starts at zero.

## Mobile quick actions

- [ ] Switch between Record observation, Roll, Star chart, Pattern analysis, Games and Messaging using the bottom bar.
- [ ] Confirm Record observation shows the liquids, wetting and diaper-change forms together.
- [ ] Enter a draft, switch away and return; confirm the form retains its values.
- [ ] Verify Back/Forward, offline reopening, and returning from Settings.
- [ ] Check form buttons and notifications remain reachable above the bar and phone home indicator.

## Linked Potty chart (2026-09-12)

- [ ] Open Potty chart from Little Log's navigation or installed-app shortcut.
- [ ] Sign in; confirm the browser chart links and uploads automatically.
- [ ] Check that its file ID matches your observation participant.
- [ ] On a fresh second device, confirm the saved chart loads automatically.
- [ ] Sign in with a different guest chart; confirm automatic merging retains both sets of row meanings and stars.
- [ ] Edit offline, reopen and reconnect; confirm automatic merging and retries complete without a version-choice prompt.
- [ ] Download a chart backup before clearing or replacing content you want to keep.
- [ ] Confirm switching accounts cannot upload the previous account's chart.
- [ ] Clear chart & reset rows, sync, and confirm cleared stars stay cleared.
- [ ] Sign out & clear this browser chart only removes this chart's local copy.

On mobile, open Record observation in the bottom bar and scroll to the diaper-change form to save a completed diaper and its final wetting count. Switching tabs preserves your unsaved form.

Potty chart is a native Little Log view at #potty-chart. Navigation keeps the same document and preserves drafts; the app header shows chart sync status on this route. Existing ldq-growth-chart-v2 saves are reused. Old chart URLs and the PWA shortcut lead to the integrated view, and OAuth returns there. Run node scripts/embed-growth-chart.mjs after editing bundled chart markup/styles; the source importer also runs it. Commit index.html and potty_chart/embedded.css with the matching chart scripts and worker. Static deployments must include the updated nginx chart redirects.

Roll desperation: the four-step slider records low/medium/high/crisis on each new roll (displayed Low/Med/High/Crisis), without changing probability or cooldown. History, JSON/CSV backups, database sync and admin exports retain the field. Older rolls omit it and appear as Not recorded in the admin distribution. The chosen level stays selected while switching views and after saving; a new page starts at Low. Tests/desperation.test.mjs covers validation, sync and export round trips; tests/training-browser.mjs checks keyboard steps, saving and mobile draft retention.

## Stickers and market

- Connect your device in Settings so saved observations, wettings and diaper changes can earn account stickers. Offline records earn when they sync.
- Open Stickers & market to see each type owned, listed and earned, plus LiDollCoins and separate spendable stars.
- Sell to the stickerbank, buy from other users, list a coin sale or offer a sticker swap. Check the displayed whole-number total.
- Cancel your own listing to release its reserved stickers. Retry an unconfirmed exchange with Retry pending exchange.
- Chart progress remains intact; each dated row cell earns its separate star once. Star spending will arrive later.

## Choose your theme

Open Settings and choose **Little Log** for soft pastels or **Caregiver Tracker** for the original dark look. Little Log is the default. Changes apply immediately and save on this device; forms stay filled while you switch.

- Home reminders scroll horizontally; use Pause to stop them. Reduced-motion settings display the full text without scrolling.
- Administrators: open Admin console > Reminders, enter up to 500 characters, enable Show this reminder, then Save reminder. Turn Show off and save to hide it while retaining the text. Published reminders are visible to signed-out visitors too.

- Administrators: **Admin console > Reminders > Margin note** edits the home-page tips separately from the scrolling header. Enter up to 2,000 characters, keep line breaks if wanted, and save. Use **Show this margin note** to publish or hide it.

- **Settings > Manage connected games** lets you approve a LiDollQuest connection code or disconnect an app. A linked game earns/spends from the same LiDollCoin wallet; saved local gold is not deposited.


## Additional event choices

Bedwetting and Used the potty are separate choices in Record a wetting and its edit dialog. Both retain their category through history, JSON/CSV and account sync. Used the potty does not increase the suggested diaper wetting total. Both count as recorded events for interval estimates, but have no F/SF/V/SI/I probability weight, ordinal action score or category performance bonus; a day with none of the original five categories follows the existing empty-day rule.


## Shared recording reward modal

After saving an observation, a wetting or a diaper change, dismiss the reward modal to continue. Online synced saves show the earned sticker with the same sound and confetti preferences. Offline or signed-out saves show a pending message; reconnect and sync, then use the retry button to retrieve the sticker.


## Login bonuses and diamonds

Save and sync one observation, wetting, diaper change or roll each day for a growing bonus. Visit Login bonuses in the menu for weekly/monthly calendars and daily statistics. Use Stickers & market to exchange diamonds for coins at 1:50. Offline saves qualify on their sync day; see LOGIN_BONUSES_GUIDE.md for streak rules.

## Administrator analysis checks

With an administrator account, open Admin console → AI analysis, save a prompt and queue a report. Reopen the page to review the saved document and download Markdown. Ordinary participant accounts cannot use this feature. See [AI_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md](AI_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md) for the daily schedule.

## New-account coins

A new Little Log account receives 50 lid0llcoins. Check Stickers & market for the balance and welcome entry. Spending the coins or signing in again does not refill this grant; existing tracker accounts retain their previous balances.

## Administrator report sharing

Admins can set a report output limit up to 50,000 tokens and create or revoke MommyBot report-read tokens from AI analysis. Ordinary wallet connections cannot read these reports. See [AI_REPORT_API.md](AI_REPORT_API.md) for setting up a consumer.

Use **Run and share with MommyBot** to request an on-demand report for the bot's polling feed. **Run now** keeps an ordinary manual report private. Nightly reports continue to enter the feed automatically after completion.

- **Community support** in notification settings shares your display name with your daily check-in and receives other members' check-ins. Select **Share anonymously** and save to hide your name. It starts checked when first enabling notifications, and existing notification subscribers are enrolled once when this update is deployed. Uncheck and save to stop both directions on all devices; quiet hours still apply.

- Open Friends to search for members and accept requests. In History, preview a synced record with Share with friend before granting access. Manage Shared by me to stop sharing. Enable Friends only in notification settings to exchange community check-ins only with accepted friends.


- Open **Social > Post** to post text and up to four pictures. Choose Friends or Public
  before posting; Public reaches all signed-in members. Switch the feed selector
  to browse public posts. Delete your own posts from their cards.
- Open **Social > Messaging**, select an accepted friend and send a private text message.
  Unread counts clear after opening the latest messages. Removing a friend
  deletes your conversation for both people. See [SOCIAL_GUIDE.md](SOCIAL_GUIDE.md).


- Automatic bathroom/water posts appear as short activity lines (for example
  "Alice drank 250 mL of water" or "Alice used the potty :(") marked
  **AUTO-LOGGED**, so they're easy to tell apart from real updates.
- Like posts and comments, and open Comments to join the conversation. Choose
  **Reply** under a comment to answer it in a thread.
- Keep scrolling the feed: older updates load in automatically until you see
  **You're all caught up ✨**.
- Use **Show** at the top of the feed to see **All**, only **Posts**, or only
  **Auto-updates** (automatic logs and rolls).
- Want friends to see your rolls? Tick **Automatically post my rolls** in
  **Settings → Records on your timeline**. Each roll posts its result, whether
  it was desperation mode, and how many holds you rolled in a row.
- Wear protection 24/7? Turn on **Settings → 24/7 badge** to show a **24/7**
  chip next to Friends/Public on your posts. Turn it off any time.
- Choose **🎁 Add sticker** under a comment, reply or message box to send one
  of your stickers as a gift. It leaves your collection and goes to the post
  author, the comment author you replied to, or your messaging friend. Text is
  optional with a sticker, and deleting the comment later doesn't take it back.
- Delete your own comments with **Delete**. You can't delete other people's
  comments on your posts; use **Report** instead.
- Use a post's **Options ▾** menu (under its Friends/Public label) to delete your
  own post or report someone else's. Use Report on a comment or received
  message to ask administrators to review it.
- Open Activity for stored notifications, unread counts and links to posts.
  Mark individual items or all current notifications as read.
- In notification settings, uncheck Likes on my posts, Comments on my posts or
  New posts from friends to opt out of those pushes, then save. Activity remains
  available. These three choices start on for existing notification subscribers.
- Administrators: use Social moderation to review reports and posts, enter a
  reason, and remove content or pause/restore social access.

- Activity includes saved push notifications. Community-support notices appear
  only while Community support is enabled in Settings; other push history remains
  visible when that option is off.
- Messages from Little Log admins always arrive on your Notifications page, even
  if you never turned push notifications on, or your device cannot do push at all
  (for example a browser without a Home Screen install). The **Messages from
  admins** checkbox in Settings only decides whether you also get a lock-screen
  alert; unchecking it never hides the message from Notifications.

Social groups Post, Feed, Friends & search, Messaging, Notifications and Profile behind
one main-menu tab. Use Friends & search in the bottom bar to manage friends
and shared records.

Post is the first Social bottom-bar tab. Write updates there and browse them
in Feed; unsent text, photos and audience choices survive switching tabs.

- In the main menu, Social comes immediately before Login bonuses.

Menu labels and icons: Little Log uses a drip; My Star Chart keeps four squares;
Stickers uses a smiley in a circle; Games uses a controller; Social uses a person;
Login bonuses uses a star. History, Settings and About retain their icons.

- In Settings, choose a profile picture, review its square preview, then Save.
  Check it beside your name in Social; replace it or use Remove picture.
- Profile pictures are visible to signed-in members. Admins can remove them
  through Social moderation > Profile pictures.

- Post a full-resolution camera photo through Social > Post. Little Log resizes
  it automatically; you can choose originals up to 100 MB each without manually
  shrinking them. If the server needs smaller pictures, it retries automatically.

Use **Notifications** in the top bar to open your Social notification history.
**Join Discord** is in the side menu, below About, and opens in a new tab.

- Swipe through multi-photo posts, or use Previous photo / Next photo. The
  counter tracks your position; keyboard users can focus the gallery and use
  arrow keys, Home or End.

- Open Social > Profile to see your picture and posts, or click another person's
  name to visit their profile. Profiles only show posts shared with you.
- Use Edit profile picture on your own profile to open its Settings controls.
