# Testing guide

`node tests/social-gate-browser.mjs` checks every guest Social deep link, forged
local account state, hidden controls, authenticated access without tracker data,
revoked sessions, offline cleanup and re-entry, plus both themes at mobile and
desktop widths. `tests/social.test.mjs` checks direct guest API reads and writes,
including images. The theme browser suite checks guest gate layouts; the Social
browser suite covers the authenticated forms and navigation.

`tests/desperation-mode.test.mjs` verifies halving across all random modifiers and bounds, exact half-percent outcomes, mode validation, unchanged daily base behavior, 30-minute deadlines and backup/sync/export retention. `node tests/desperation-mode-browser.mjs` checks the actual selector and preview, remembered preference, saved mode/history, disabling mode during a cooldown, deletion plus offline reload, exact expiry, normal-mode restoration and the mobile roll page.

The Hold-result roll cooldown is fifteen minutes. The protocol unit/browser tests check that ten minutes remains blocked, the last second stays blocked, and exactly fifteen minutes unlocks rolling, including after offline reload and deletion of the original roll.

## Persistent device sessions

`npm test` covers 30-day inactivity, daily renewal, the 180-day cap, legacy migration, database restart, exact cookie lifetimes, CSRF, identity isolation and revocation in `tests/sessions.test.mjs`. `node tests/sessions-browser.mjs` closes/reopens a real persistent Chrome profile and checks continued sign-in, HttpOnly protection and durable logout. `node tests/connected-browser.mjs` additionally verifies that the real OIDC callback issues a persistent cookie. Browser tests use synthetic accounts and isolated artifact directories.

## Admin statistics API and CrowPanel

`npm test` includes `tests/statistics.test.mjs`: admin-only token creation/use, self/all scopes, demotion/disabling/revocation, digest-only persistence, HTTP/CSRF boundaries, bounded dates, participant pagination, overview versus individual counts, cumulative intake, chart stars and deleted records. `node tests/statistics-browser.mjs` verifies token setup, literal device labels, both views, revocation/hiding, mobile layout and authorization cleanup using synthetic data.

The companion `F:\Langley\Documents\Arduino\lidoll-logger\ps\build.ps1` compiles against esp32 3.3.10, LovyanGFX 1.2.26 and ArduinoJson 7.4.3. Its README lists physical display/touch/reconnection checks; compilation does not verify board operation. See [STATISTICS_API.md](STATISTICS_API.md).

## Automated regression tests

```sh
node --test tests/*.test.mjs
```

These cover all 101 probability settings, rejection sampling, cumulative snapshots, calendar boundaries, schema/import validation, CSV fields, SQLite persistence and backups, participant isolation, idempotent retries, transaction rollback, version conflicts, deletion tombstones, app sessions, password hashing/reset/disable, OIDC adapter persistence, and login throttling. HTTP checks verify public assets, redirects, headers, and rejection of unauthenticated or cross-origin data access. Databases use isolated directories under ignored `artifacts/`.

`tests/training.test.mjs` covers daily ties, empty days, both bounds and movement away from them, completed-day-only adjustments, legacy snapshots, DST/timezones, deterministic enrollment selection, cooldown boundaries, original results surviving corrections, typed event backups/exports, multi-device synchronization, and migration from SQLite version 1 without losing records or retry receipts.

`tests/observations.test.mjs` verifies interval sums, overlapping legacy cumulative snapshots, date attribution, separation of draw and observation fields, measurement-mode validation/exports, retry idempotency, second-device synchronization and totals after edits/deletions. The browser workflow verifies observation editing and intake reset; the protocol browser workflow checks that rolling preserves an unfinished observation and that saving during cooldown never creates another roll.

Historical-field coverage verifies that roll position and older per-diaper totals survive SQLite, exports and second-device sync. New totals belong to `diaper-change` records. `tests/diapers.test.mjs` covers dry changes, daily totals, next-diaper suggestions, preserved historical counts, classification/cooldown isolation, sync, corrections, deletion and CSV/JSON round trips. The protocol browser suite records two changes, checks the next-day reset of daily change totals and edits/deletes a change, while verifying the new card stays below the wetting card on mobile.

`tests/registration.test.mjs` starts an isolated auth service and uses real OIDC interactions to test registration pages, missing/expired cookies, invalid or wrong-action CSRF tokens, foreign origins, server-side field validation, escaped error output, normalized usernames, replay rejection, duplicate protection, and durable throttling. `tests/auth.test.mjs` also races two account creations and confirms only one password wins, with disabled accounts remaining protected.

## Deployment regression checks

`node --test tests/deploy.test.mjs` exercises activation sequencing, rollback, backup failures, first-deploy failures, environment validation, firewall source restrictions, and systemd isolation without touching host services. A real temporary Git repository also verifies fetch, detached staging, unchanged-commit detection, and preservation of the previous release. Git must be installed for this test. Run `bash -n deploy/fedora-deploy.sh` and `bash -n deploy/fedora-update.sh`, plus `node --check deploy/fedora.mjs`, for script syntax. The Fedora installer runs the complete `.test.mjs` suite before stopping the live services; it does not launch browser tests.

Actual dnf/systemd/SELinux/firewalld integration must be verified on Fedora. Follow [FEDORA_DEPLOYMENT.md](FEDORA_DEPLOYMENT.md), including a public-domain sign-in check after configuring the reverse proxy.

The command-runner regression launches real child processes from a temporary operator checkout, verifying they default to `/` while explicit staging directories still work. Unix user switching and private-home permissions require the Fedora host to verify end to end.

## Browser workflows

Start `node scripts/serve.mjs` in another terminal. The optional browser runner uses Puppeteer with an installed Chrome/Chromium. Install the testing dependency with `npm install --no-save --package-lock=false puppeteer-core`, or set `PUPPETEER_MODULE` to an existing Puppeteer module file. Set `CHROME_PATH` to the browser executable and run:

```sh
node tests/browser.mjs
node tests/training-browser.mjs
```

`TEST_URL` defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:4173/tracker/`. The runner uses an isolated browser context and synthetic data, so it does not access normal Chrome-profile records. It writes screenshots and test-only backup files to ignored `artifacts/`.

The workflow covers independent observation logging and interval intake totals, daily carry-forward/reset, independent wetting counts, persistence after reload, charts, filters, editing, JSON/CSV downloads, valid and invalid imports, preferences, offline reload and saving, 390px phone layout, deletion, quota errors, and corrupt-data recovery. Screenshot fixtures are synthetic; the application ships with an empty history.

The protocol browser workflow uses a controlled clock and deterministic test-only RNG to verify blocked repeat rolls, exact countdown expiry, wetting/observation logging during cooldown, preservation of unsaved intake during a roll, offline reload, midnight decreases, empty-day increases, retrospective corrections, historical probability preservation, wetting filters/deletion, and all routes at six viewport widths. It writes `artifacts/protocol-desktop.png` and `artifacts/protocol-mobile.png`.

It also checks that the CRT FX button is gone and that an old saved `ldq-crt-effect=on` value no longer turns scanlines on in the caregiver theme. (Start the server with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` in Git Bash, or `BASE_PATH=/tracker/` is rewritten into a Windows path.) For visual releases, inspect desktop and phone screenshots, chart/legend colors, visible focus rings, dark native date/select controls, and sign-in/consent contrast. Check all four routes (Overview, Record archive, Settings, and About) at 320, 390, 680, 768, 1024, and 1440 pixels for document overflow. The icon generator and HTTP tests cover all install-icon sizes; visual inspection verifies the sigil itself.

## Connected browser and shared-auth workflows

With the same Puppeteer and CHROME_PATH configuration, run:

```sh
node tests/connected-browser.mjs
```

This runner starts its own isolated tracker and identity services on ports 43173 and 43180, creates synthetic Alice/Bob accounts, and stops only its own processes afterward. It exercises the full OIDC authorization-code/PKCE login and consent flow, migration of local entries, HttpOnly cookies and CSRF checks, another device restoring the same account, offline reload and reconnect, participant isolation, conflicting edits, central analysis export, sign-out, and narrow-screen settings. A separate registered future-app client verifies shared sign-on with the same stable subject and rejects authorization-code replay.

Alice is created through the web registration form, while Bob uses administrator provisioning. The browser verifies password-confirmation errors, duplicate-name rejection, 320/390px layout, consent after signup, explicit local-record upload, and subsequent sign-in on another device. Registration screenshots are saved alongside the other synthetic artifacts before entering passwords.

The second device signs in using the header button from Record archive. The suite confirms that authenticated but unconnected users see **Connect device**, that it opens and focuses the Settings connection action, and that the header button disappears once connected.

The connected suite also syncs enrollment and a classified wetting to the second device, compares displayed chances, and verifies those typed records appear in the central analysis export.

## Release checks on the target host

1. Verify `/tracker` redirects to `/tracker/`, all manifest icons return 200 with the correct MIME types, and `/tracker/sw.js` revalidates.
2. Check the site over HTTPS and install on real iOS/Safari and Android/Chrome devices. Browser automation does not verify the native installation menus.
3. Make a check-in, close/reopen, then switch offline and repeat. Check storage separately in browser and installed app on platforms that isolate them.
4. Use keyboard-only navigation, native radio arrow keys, a screen reader, and chart data tables. Check 200% zoom and a narrow phone viewport.
5. With two tabs, change records in one and verify the other refreshes. An already-open edit must reject an entry changed in the other tab.
6. Export before clearing browser data; import afterward and compare fields. Confirm entries upload only through the authenticated app API, the API returns no-store, and login credentials never appear in URLs, localStorage, or exports.
7. Bump the service-worker cache version, deploy the full app, and verify the new version activates after all old app tabs close.
8. On the production proxy, verify HTTPS discovery/keys, exact callback configuration, Secure/HttpOnly cookies, and trusted proxy headers. Confirm both databases survive a service restart and both database backups can be restored in an isolated environment.

Nginx snippets are deployment templates; validate them against the real server configuration with `nginx -t`. Live domain deployment, real-device installation, and screen-reader checks require the actual hosting/devices and are not implied by local tests.

For a new auth proxy host, follow [AUTH_PROXY_SETUP.md](AUTH_PROXY_SETUP.md): validate the HTTP bootstrap before certificate issuance, then validate the complete HTTPS configuration before reload. Check HTTP redirects to the fixed auth origin, certificate challenge URLs remain local, HTTPS discovery reports the correct issuer, and the real OIDC sign-in succeeds. Verify Certbot renewal with `certbot renew --dry-run` and confirm a renewal schedule and Nginx reload hook exist.


## Intake units

`tests/training-browser.mjs` checks conversion of 250 mL, saving 12.5 US fl oz as
370 mL, repeated toggling without draft drift, blank and invalid amounts, the
maximum allowed intake, reset after saving, preference after offline reload,
and layout at 320px. Saved records and record editing continue to use whole mL.

## Mobile quick actions

`tests/training-browser.mjs` checks the bottom bar at 320/390/680px, all three
panel destinations, unsaved form retention, Back/Forward, return from Settings, offline
reopening, touch targets, bottom clearance and the unchanged desktop dashboard.
On a real phone, also check the home-indicator safe area and form scrolling with
the keyboard open. The bar switches panels without saving records or rolling.

The bar order is Record observation, Roll, Star chart, Pattern analysis, Games, Messaging;
`tests/message-badge-browser.mjs` asserts that exact href order.
`node tests/infinite-feed-browser.mjs` (Puppeteer) seeds 45 posts and scrolls
the phone feed: pages load in order with no gaps or duplicates, the caught-up
note appears above the Social bar, filters restart from the newest page, the
**Load more updates** button works, and a very tall window fills itself. The
sticker browser test now waits for the feed's first load before opening
comments (it was occasionally racing it).

`tests/feed-filter.test.mjs` (in `npm test`) checks the feed's All / Posts /
Auto-updates filter, including paging inside a filter and bad values;
`node tests/record-posts-browser.mjs` switches the **Show** dropdown in Chrome.

`tests/roll-posts.test.mjs` (in `npm test`) checks the separate roll opt-in,
older clients keeping the saved choice, the post text, desperation mode, hold
streaks (unposted earlier rolls count, other records don't break it, pee rolls
report the streak before them), edits and deletion. `tests/social-activity.test.mjs`
covers the **Rolls** push mute. `node tests/record-posts-browser.mjs` checks the
🎲 roll line and its mode/streak chips; `node tests/record-sharing-browser.mjs`
ticks the Rolls checkbox and now expects the activity-line feed wording.

`node tests/menu-swipe-browser.mjs` (Puppeteer) checks the phone menu swipe:
a right swipe starting within 40px of the left edge opens the drawer, a left
swipe closes it, and swipes from the middle, short swipes, mostly vertical drags
and desktop widths are ignored. Touch events are dispatched inside the page
because Chrome's own swipe-to-go-back would otherwise leave the test page. Try
it on a real phone too (see the note in CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md).

`tests/full-time-badge.test.mjs` (in `npm test`) checks the 24/7 badge: off by
default, version conflicts, bad input, the badge on old and new posts, the kept
start date, paused accounts, and admin statistics (active members only, repeat
saves not counted, the 30-day window, admin-only access). With Puppeteer set up,
`node tests/full-time-badge-browser.mjs` saves the badge in Settings, checks the
chip sits left of the Public pill at 320/390/1024px, reads the admin
**24/7 badges** view and turns the badge off again.

`tests/sticker-gifts.test.mjs` (in `npm test`) checks sticker comments, replies
and messages: who receives the sticker, retry safety, no self-gifts, empty
inventory, optional text, friendship checks, gifts surviving message removal,
immediate returns after a failed save and the reconciler's settle/return/kept
paths. With `PUPPETEER_MODULE` and `CHROME_PATH` set, run
`node tests/sticker-gifts-browser.mjs` to click through the real picker: hidden
on your own post, counts, a sticker-only comment, a text + sticker message, the
empty-inventory notice and the recipient's view, then checks the 412px phone
layout (Send beside the message box, full-width picker below it, a single
swipeable row of stickers, and the sent sticker on its own line). Screenshots are saved under
`artifacts/sticker-gifts-browser-*`.

`tests/message-badge-browser.mjs` checks the main and Social unread badges,
15-second polling, read clearing, stored conversation links, both themes and
sign-out cleanup. `tests/message-notifications.test.mjs` checks recipient-only
counts and pushes, retries, safe payloads, read cancellation, opt-out, deletion,
friendship revocation and disabled senders. The notifications browser suite also
checks the saved New messages preference across reloads and re-enrollment.

## In-app admin messages (2026-09-17)

`npm test` includes `tests/notification-messages.test.mjs`, which now asserts
that the audience is every enabled member except the sending admin, that a
member with **Messages from admins** unchecked still has the message on their
Notifications page (`db.activity.list(...)`), that the author never notifies
themselves, and that an audience with no live member is still refused with 400.

Run the composer regression with `PUPPETEER_MODULE` and `CHROME_PATH` set:

```
node tests/notification-messages-browser.mjs
```

It checks the `N members in-app / D devices with push` audience line, that
**Send notification** stays enabled when Web Push is unconfigured (in-app only)
and when the recipient has zero push devices, that the in-app copy is stored
before any push is attempted, that **Cancel queued** retracts unread in-app
copies, and that a disabled recipient still disables Send rather than silently
becoming a broadcast. Push transport is mocked; no live messages are sent.

## Linked Growth Chart (2026-09-12)

`npm test` includes growth-chart.test.mjs: bounded validation, SQLite persistence,
participant isolation, CSRF/origin checks, stale writes, lost-response receipts,
clearing and explicit issuer migration/collision rollback. Row-meaning coverage
checks custom labels/notes, renames, reordered rows, duplicate labels, participant
isolation, database reopening and operator JSON exports.

Run `node tests/growth-chart-browser.mjs` with `PUPPETEER_MODULE` pointing to an
installed Puppeteer module and `CHROME_PATH` pointing to installed Chrome.
It creates temporary local auth/tracker services and synthetic accounts under
artifacts/, exercises real OAuth/consent and the chart callback, verifies
automatic linking, renamed/custom row and star restoration on a second device,
fresh-device/session restore, automatic first-link merging,
automatic offline merging, lost-response
retries, account isolation, clearing and phone layout. It does not contact or
change production. A restricted environment may need permission to start the
headless browser. Actual installation and shared browser/installed-app storage
still need testing on the intended phones. See GROWTH_CHART_GUIDE.md.

Semi-Forced coverage in `tests/training.test.mjs` verifies JSON/CSV validation, participant-scoped SQLite sync and second-device restore, SF-only completed days, ties with involuntary events and today's next-day preview. Check both Classification menus show F, SF, V, SI, I in that order; saving/editing SF must retain its history label and About-page count.

Admin chart legends: at desktop and 320px widths, verify every chart has readable series labels beside 9px color keys; the intake scatter legend explains its points and both axes. Color keys must not inherit the full plot size.

Admin Potty charts tab: the four chart graphs and row-meaning table live beside participant drilldowns. Statistics respect cohort/date filters; the read-only weekly chart and expandable row histories show the complete current saved chart. Missing charts are explicit, and authorization loss clears chart details from memory and the page. `tests/admin-browser.mjs` checks chart navigation, weekly stars, participant switching, date-filter separation and phone layouts.

Admin chart freshness regression: change a participant chart through its own UI after the admin dataset loads, wait for sync, then open View chart. Verify renamed/new rows and all saved stars match the participant chart and database. Drilldowns and participant selections fetch current data; failed reads must not silently display the older snapshot.

Automatic chart synchronization: Chart sync now combines unsynced edits against the last acknowledged base, retries failed uploads with the same mutation receipt, and refreshes across tabs and every 15 visible seconds. Independent row fields and star additions/removals merge; a pending local edit wins a simultaneous edit to the same field. First-link guest rows with different meanings receive separate IDs and keep their stars. Account mismatches still block upload; storage or combined-size limits report an error without discarding either copy. A closed PWA must reopen to upload offline edits. Admin chart views poll the protected chart-only endpoint every 15 seconds while visible, and refresh on focus or same-origin save notifications. No observation datasets are polled. The shared merge.js asset must ship in both chart shells and offline caches. Browser regression coverage includes actual saved chart edits reaching the admin view, cross-tab draft preservation, automatic guest/offline merges, 409 retries and lost-response receipts.

Potty chart is a native Little Log view at #potty-chart. Navigation keeps the same document and preserves drafts; the app header shows chart sync status on this route. Existing ldq-growth-chart-v2 saves are reused. Old chart URLs and the PWA shortcut lead to the integrated view, and OAuth returns there. Run node scripts/embed-growth-chart.mjs after editing bundled chart markup/styles; the source importer also runs it. Commit index.html and potty_chart/embedded.css with the matching chart scripts and worker. Static deployments must include the updated nginx chart redirects.

Roll desperation: the four-step slider records low/medium/high/crisis on each new roll (displayed Low/Med/High/Crisis), without changing probability or cooldown. History, JSON/CSV backups, database sync and admin exports retain the field. Older rolls omit it and appear as Not recorded in the admin distribution. The chosen level stays selected while switching views and after saving; a new page starts at Low. Tests/desperation.test.mjs covers validation, sync and export round trips; tests/training-browser.mjs checks keyboard steps, saving and mobile draft retention.

## Separate market database

Run `node --test tests/economy.test.mjs` for reward receipts, existing imports, separate star currency, bank conversion and inventory, distinct demand and expiry, escrow, swaps, insufficient funds, CSRF/account isolation, unavailable market recovery and replay after a market commit. The isolation regression checks that science has no market tables and market has no scientific records or sessions.

With PUPPETEER_MODULE and CHROME_PATH configured, run `node tests/economy-browser.mjs`. It starts disposable local storage, loads the actual sprite collection, and verifies actual image loading, five viewport widths, bank sales, peer purchases, an interrupted response retried after reload, and sign-out. Never point test DATA_DIR at live account data.

Duplicate-design coverage verifies 13-16 merge into 1-4 while preserving player and bank holdings, earned counts, open sale listings, requested swap types, unchanged coins, historical trades and old request receipts. It also checks automatic same-design swap cancellation, repeat migration safety, and rollback when combined holdings would exceed the integer balance limit.

The market browser workflow opens sales from a gallery sticker, verifies its preselected type and five modal widths, checks Escape and Close without a transaction, opens bank purchases, and verifies successful sales close the dialog while uncertain results keep a retry available.

## Theme selector

Run `node tests/theme-browser.mjs` with PUPPETEER_MODULE and CHROME_PATH configured. It checks the pastel default, both themes across five widths and five pages, saved selection, unchanged form drafts, cross-tab updates, offline reload, and graceful behavior when preference storage is blocked. Screenshots of both themes and the mobile chart/settings pages are written to an isolated artifacts/themes directory. The existing CRT browser regression selects Caregiver Tracker before checking its original default-on behavior.

Admin reminders: `npm test` includes persistence, input validation, stale-edit protection, retry auditing, public draft redaction and admin/CSRF checks. Run `node tests/reminder-browser.mjs` with PUPPETEER_MODULE and CHROME_PATH configured to check publishing, updates, hiding, literal text rendering, mobile layout, pause and reduced motion in both themes against a temporary local database.

The reminder suites also cover margin-note publishing, independent versions and drafts, preserved line breaks, hidden-draft redaction, authorization, reload persistence and text wrapping in both themes.

Stickerbank purchase removal: economy tests verify that rejected bank purchases leave balances, stock, demand and history unchanged. The economy browser check confirms purchase controls are absent while bank sales and peer purchases still work.

LiDollCoin API: `tests/coin-api.test.mjs` checks relative operations, receipts/refunds, consent, scopes, persistence, account isolation, token expiry, polling backoff, CSRF and CORS. `tests/coin-browser.mjs` checks the signed-in approval and revocation interface with actual local API requests and mobile widths.

LiDollQuest browser sign-in uses the first-party wallet session described in LIDOLLCOIN_API.md: same-tab LiD0llID sign-in, first consent, automatic return and restore. Deploy the Node service plus public coins/browser.js before the rebuilt game. Browser grants and remembered permissions live only in market.sqlite (schema 4); the external bearer API and scientific-data storage remain separate.

## Personal potty estimates

Pattern analysis includes a per-profile next-wetting model using actual wetting intervals and, when chronological validation supports it, intake timing and a learned fluid-response delay. It runs offline from the existing scientific records and updates after changes or sync. See [PREDICTION_GUIDE.md](PREDICTION_GUIDE.md) for inputs, limits, validation, deployment and browser tests. No database migration or external model service is needed.

## Admin participant predictions

In Admin, open **Predictions** and select one participant, or choose **Prediction** from their User management row. The shared renderer uses the same personal model and probability chart as Little Log. It reads the selected user through the existing admin-authorized data endpoint, independently of analysis date filters. Records refresh every 30 seconds while the panel is visible, and **Refresh estimate** fetches immediately. Unsynced device records are unavailable to the admin; timestamps use the admin browser timezone. Everyone shows a selection prompt instead of pooling users into a model.

All model inputs remain in memory. Switching participants, leaving the panel or losing authorization clears the rendered estimate and training cache; late responses cannot replace another participant?s view. No extra database migration or storage is added. The admin renderer bypasses older installed PWA shell caches, and shell v41 includes the shared module update. Run `node tests/admin-prediction-browser.mjs` to verify user drilldown, fresh data, selection races, empty histories, mobile layout, session revocation and ordinary-user denial with isolated synthetic accounts.


### Connected-game stars
The shared wallet API now supports explicitly authorized star credit/debit/refund operations in market schema 5. See LIDOLLCOIN_API.md for migration and deployment order. Run `npm test` for currency isolation, legacy receipts/consent migration, integer and balance limits, star scopes, chart preservation, ledger persistence, refunds and browser origin/CSRF checks.


### Overnight diaper continuity
`node tests/diapers-browser.mjs` starts an isolated local app and verifies mobile midnight rollover, an overnight wetting, reload persistence, changing the carried diaper, and backdated change suggestions. `npm test` includes day boundaries, old reset-number records and same-second change/wetting ordering. Current diaper numbers and their suggested totals carry across dates; only recorded changes today reset.

The overnight regression also checks that the first morning change starts diaper #1, reload retains it, and a second change starts #2. Unit coverage includes skipped days and a first change after observation-only history.


## Games navigation

`npm test` includes `tests/games.test.mjs` for safe configured origins, fixed redirects, methods and shell integration. With `PUPPETEER_MODULE` and `CHROME_PATH` set, run `node tests/games-browser.mjs` for all four cards, both themes, five widths, mobile navigation, preserved drafts and offline/reconnect behavior. The fixture blocks network requests and separately supplies the browser connectivity signal across reloads. `tests/theme-browser.mjs` checks all nine menu destinations, including Games. See [GAMES_GUIDE.md](GAMES_GUIDE.md) for the live deployment check.


## Additional event choices

Bedwetting and Used the potty are separate choices in Record a wetting and its edit dialog. Both retain their category through history, JSON/CSV and account sync. Used the potty does not increase the suggested diaper wetting total. Both count as recorded events for interval estimates, but have no F/SF/V/SI/I probability weight, ordinal action score or category performance bonus; a day with none of the original five categories follows the existing empty-day rule. Verify both options can be saved, reloaded, edited and deleted, and that potty use leaves the diaper suggestion unchanged.


## Shared recording reward modal

Run node tests/observation-reward-browser.mjs with PUPPETEER_MODULE and CHROME_PATH configured. It verifies exact receipts for observations, wettings (Voluntary, Bedwetting and Used the potty) and dry diaper changes; offline recovery, guest pending copy, shared mute/confetti behavior, one sticker per record, and dismissal. Other recording browser workflows dismiss the shared modal before continuing.


## Login bonuses and diamonds

Login bonuses and diamonds are covered by tests/login-bonuses.test.mjs, tests/diamond-api.test.mjs, and tests/login-bonuses-browser.mjs. Existing performance/economy fixtures now include the independent day-one 10-coin attendance payout. See LOGIN_BONUSES_GUIDE.md for the complete test scope.

With the MommyBot checkout beside this project (or MOMMYBOT_ROOT set), run `node tests/mommybot-diamonds-integration.mjs` to exercise its real WalletClient against an isolated tracker HTTP API: consent, balances, credit/retry, debit/refund and revocation. It sends no Discord messages and touches no live wallets.

## Admin AI analysis checks

Run `npm test` for the durable queue, saved prompt/source snapshots, admin/CSRF boundaries, Los Angeles midnight and DST cases, inference failures, cancellation and recovery. Run `node tests/ai-analysis-browser.mjs` with `PUPPETEER_MODULE` and `CHROME_PATH` configured for the real worker/browser flow using a synthetic local model endpoint. Verify the actual LAN endpoint from the deployed host separately; see [AI_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md](AI_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md).

## Registration starting balance

`npm test` includes `tests/registration-bonus.test.mjs`: new accounts start at 50 coins, spending and repeat sign-ins never refill them, old accounts receive no retroactive grant, and market outages/replayed delivery preserve exactly one credit. Market, wallet API and daily-bonus tests account for the separate 50-coin starting balance.

## Report-read API and 50k output

`npm test` includes `tests/ai-report-api.test.mjs`: 50,000-token validation and inference payloads, one-time settings migration, out-of-order completion cursors, historical backfill, digest-only credentials, role checks, revocation and read-only HTTP access. `node tests/ai-analysis-browser.mjs` also checks token creation/hiding/revocation and credential cleanup after lost admin access. Tests use synthetic reports and send no Discord messages.

The report API tests also verify nightly/explicit-share eligibility, hidden historical private reports, sharing-safe retries and migration defaults. The browser test completes a private run, verifies an empty bot feed, then uses **Run and share with MommyBot** and verifies that only the explicitly shared completed document appears.


Community support: run node --test tests/community-support.test.mjs for default preferences, one-time existing-subscriber enrollment across both schema versions, persisted opt-outs after restart, daily record and roll triggers, recipient snapshots, duplicate prevention, quiet hours, opt-outs, disabled accounts, restart recovery, expired endpoints and named/anonymous push rendering, anonymous preference persistence, and privacy changes on pending events. The notifications browser fixture also verifies default-on, saving an opt-out, reload/new-device persistence and responsive layout. Push transport is mocked; production delivery requires configured Web Push and an actual subscribed device.


Friends: tests/friends.test.mjs covers search privacy, recipient-only acceptance, per-record ownership/version checks, revocation, restart persistence, pagination, friends-only audiences and authenticated HTTP behavior. tests/friends-browser.mjs uses two browser accounts for request/accept/share/read/revoke, safe display-name rendering, both themes at five widths and private cache cleanup. Notification browser tests cover friends-only preference persistence. The theme suite now checks nine menu destinations, including Social, including Updates and Messages.


## Status updates, public feed and messages

`npm test` includes `tests/social.test.mjs` for Friends/Public isolation,
authenticated picture reads, decoding and metadata removal, input limits,
pagination, retry safety, deletion, private conversations, unread markers,
restart persistence and session/CSRF enforcement. Run
`node tests/social-browser.mjs` with `PUPPETEER_MODULE` and `CHROME_PATH` for
three-account photo uploads, feed visibility, messaging/replies, unread counts,
safe text rendering, both themes, mobile widths and private cache cleanup.
The existing friends and theme browser suites cover the new Message action and
menu routes. See [SOCIAL_GUIDE.md](SOCIAL_GUIDE.md) for deployment checks,
including the separate Nginx picture upload limit.


## Reactions, moderation and stored activity

`tests/social-activity.test.mjs` covers audience checks, retry safety, comment
ownership/pagination, report permissions, moderator actions/audit, reported
private messages, protected admin pictures, migration defaults, stored history,
read state, quiet hours, opt-outs, disabled accounts, revoked audiences, expired
endpoints and push click routing. Run `node tests/social-activity-browser.mjs`
for real likes/comments, report submission, activity links/read state, admin
removal/restriction/restoration/dismissal, reported messages and role revocation.
The threaded-comments unit test covers replies (retries, wrong-post and
missing parents), one owner alert per comment, reply and comment-like alerts,
comment-like privacy, author-only deletion, removed-parent placeholders and
post deletion. Run `node tests/comment-threads-browser.mjs` (needs
`PUPPETEER_MODULE` and `CHROME_PATH`) to check the post **Options** dropdown
(Delete for owners, Report for others; outside click and Escape close it),
nested reply boxes, comment likes, the missing Delete on other members'
comments, removed-comment placeholders, activity alerts and 320/390/1024px
layouts in both themes. Screenshots land in `artifacts/`.
`tests/record-sharing.test.mjs` also checks the `record` details on automatic
posts (and `null` on manual ones). Run `node tests/record-posts-browser.mjs` to
check the activity-line layout for water, diaper change, accident, potty and
diaper-use posts next to a normal update, in both themes at 320/390/1024px.
`tests/notifications-browser.mjs` verifies all three default-on social settings
and opt-outs across reloads/devices. Push tests use mocked transport; production
Web Push delivery still requires a subscribed device.

Activity preference filtering: social-activity.test.mjs also verifies that turning
Community support off hides its stored notices before pagination, unread counts
and mark-as-read operations. Other push history remains visible. Re-enabling
restores earlier community notices and their read state; no notices are added
while opted out or without saved Community support enrollment.

Social navigation: the theme browser suite checks the single Social menu entry,
its bottom bar across both themes and six widths, and hidden recording actions
inside Social. Social/activity and friends browser suites enter through Social,
use its bottom links, and exercise preserved post/message/friend routes.

Post/Feed separation: theme checks cover all six bottom tabs and confirm that
the composer is visible only on Post. The social browser flow switches tabs with
a prepared photo/text draft, publishes from Post and opens View your post in
Feed. Social API tests check the private, minimal composer session response.

The theme browser suite also checks the exact main-menu order: Games, Social,
then Login bonuses, followed by History, Settings and About.

Profile pictures: `tests/profile.test.mjs` covers sanitized 512px JPEGs, identity
metadata, validation, concurrent saves, retry/removal tombstones, persistence,
CSRF/session ownership, direct image privacy and admin removal/audit. Run
`node tests/profile-browser.mjs` with PUPPETEER_MODULE and CHROME_PATH for Settings
upload/preview/replace/remove/reload, avatars throughout Social, the Friends
bottom tab, both themes at phone/desktop widths, admin removal, sign-out cleanup
and exclusion of private API images from service-worker caches.

`node tests/photo-upload-browser.mjs` generates a real 50 MP JPEG above 20 MB,
uploads it through an emulated 256 KiB proxy, and drops a successful response
to verify retry safety. It also checks four detailed photos with maximum
Unicode text/descriptions, compact avatars and image files without MIME metadata.
Use the same PUPPETEER_MODULE and CHROME_PATH variables as the social browser tests.

The admin browser test verifies that sign-in-only accounts are absent from
Participants and totals, appear after their first saved entry and disappear
after their last entry is deleted and the console is refreshed. User management
continues to provide account access controls for these accounts.

`node tests/gallery-browser.mjs` checks a real touch swipe, gallery buttons,
keyboard navigation, first/last boundaries, preserved image descriptions,
position after resizing, reduced motion and both themes at five widths. It
also verifies single-photo posts, feed/detail rendering and sign-out cleanup.
Fullscreen coverage includes opening the tapped image, native touch swipes,
portrait/landscape rotation, full-viewport bounds in both themes, captions,
keyboard opening/navigation, Close/Escape, restored focus/thumbnail position,
single-image boundaries and removal of the modal on sign-out.
Use PUPPETEER_MODULE and CHROME_PATH as for the social browser suite.

Member profiles: `tests/profile.test.mjs` checks audience-filtered pagination,
identity-only fields, disabled members and authenticated reads. Run
`node tests/member-browser.mjs` for the sixth Profile tab, name links from
posts/comments/friends/messages/conversations, self/other profiles, friendship
revocation, own post deletion, missing profiles, mobile layouts and cleanup.

Compact mobile Social: run `node tests/social-mobile-browser.mjs` with the same
PUPPETEER_MODULE and CHROME_PATH variables. It checks actual center scrolling and
stationary header/tabs at 320, 390 and 680px in both themes, long-post expansion,
inbox search/folders, hidden-thread unread isolation, 50-message pagination,
per-friend drafts, archive/restore, a 460px-high viewport with focused reply,
desktop layout restoration and sign-out cleanup. Screenshots go under artifacts.
`tests/social.test.mjs` covers archive ownership, CSRF, sessions, persistence,
new-message resurfacing, friendship removal and disabled accounts.

On a real phone, also check the installed app with the software keyboard open,
browser bars expanded/collapsed, portrait/landscape rotation and safe-area
insets. Emulated viewport resizing does not reproduce every mobile keyboard.

Timeline record sharing: `tests/record-sharing.test.mjs` covers default opt-out,
eligible types, audiences, retry/conflict/rollback behavior, source corrections
including water-log amounts and diaper-change counts,
and deletions, moderation, imports, cross-device versions, persistence and API
authorization. Run `node tests/record-sharing-browser.mjs` with PUPPETEER_MODULE
and CHROME_PATH to verify Settings controls, saved opt-in, real sync requests,
feed posts, stale-device conflicts, both mobile themes and private-data cleanup.

Record notification opt-outs: `tests/social-activity.test.mjs` checks each type
independently, manual posts, the master switch, queued-push cancellation, stored
activity, migration defaults and old-client preference preservation.
`tests/notifications-browser.mjs` verifies the three checkboxes through the real
settings API, saving, reload, device re-enrollment and mobile layouts.

## Security regression checks

Run `npm test` for `security-hardening.test.mjs`, `security-services.test.mjs` and `reward-configuration.test.mjs`. These exercise signed revocation, real malformed HTTP against both services, bounded upload admission, post fanout, activity retention, persistent reward budgets, proof-bound minting and repeatable key provisioning. Browser fixtures use disposable signed identity services; production has no fixture bypass. Run `node tests/mommybot-diamonds-integration.mjs` with the adjacent updated MommyBot checkout to verify its real wallet signer end to end. These tests do not send Discord messages or touch production accounts.
