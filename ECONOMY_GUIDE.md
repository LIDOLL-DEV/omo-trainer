# Stickers, stars and LiDollCoins

The gallery and market live at /tracker/#stickers in the main app. A synced observation, wetting or diaper change earns one uniformly random sticker within the account's 20-sticker UTC daily budget from the full active collection, using the server's cryptographic random-number generator. Rolls do not earn stickers. The gallery immediately above recent wallet activity at the bottom shows only types you currently own, including stickers reserved in your open listings. Each card tracks available quantity, reserved quantity, lifetime earned quantity, the current bank price and bank stock. You can get other sticker types through community listings and swaps.

The active collection is the 12 unique numbered images (1.png through 12.png) in sprites/. Nested folders are supported; _originals and hidden files are excluded so backup copies never become reward types. PNG, WebP, JPEG and GIF are supported. Restart the service after changes. File paths determine stable sticker IDs: do not rename published assets. Retired files keep their old inventories and trading identities. Missing assets leave earned stickers pending; opening the gallery or recording again resolves pending awards after the collection is installed. Images are lazy loaded online; the PWA caches the gallery shell but never caches wallet APIs. Trading requires an online account session.

## Two separate databases

- DATA_DIR/little-log.sqlite contains participants, scientific records, charts, sessions, admin access controls and reward_outbox entitlements.
- DATA_DIR/market.sqlite contains sticker types, wallets, inventory, reward receipts, star receipts, listings, trades, ledger entries and exchange request receipts. It has no observations, chart documents, labels, account credentials or scientific export tables.

The market receives opaque participant IDs and hashed reward source IDs. Scientific record kinds and chart row meanings stay in the scientific database. Each scientific save writes its entitlement in the same scientific transaction. After commit, the bridge delivers entitlements to the market in a separate transaction, then acknowledges delivery. A crash between those commits safely replays against unique market receipts. Market write failures leave scientific saving available. A 30-second server timer retries pending delivery; sync and gallery visits also retry. Batches are limited to 1,000 entitlements.

Existing and imported typed records are backfilled by stable ID when their owner opens the collection. Importing the same IDs, editing an entry, restoring its tombstone or replaying sync does not produce a second reward. Importing genuinely different IDs counts as new records. Scientific CSV/JSON imports and exports do not contain or replace market balances. Deleting a scientific record does not revoke an already-earned sticker.

Each dated chart row cell earns one separate spendable star for its lifetime. Removing and restoring that same cell never earns twice. Spendable stars do not change chart progress; no star spending or conversion rate is enabled yet. The market stores hashed cell receipts, not row names or chart contents.

## Pricing and exchanges

Bank price per sticker = 10 + min(990, distinct participants trading that sticker during the previous 30 days). Count completed trades only. Bank trades count their participant; participant trades count both participants; a swap counts activity for both types. The bank itself never counts as a participant. One person counts once per type regardless of trade frequency. Expired activity drops out when the next quote is read. Prices range from 10 to 1,000 whole LiDollCoins.

Bank exchanges require the displayed unit price to still match at commit; changed prices are rejected for review. Peer listings use the seller's fixed total price or requested sticker bundle. A listing reserves the offered inventory immediately. Accepting transfers both sides atomically; cancellation returns the reserved stickers. There are no partial fills or self-trades. Up to 100 open listings are allowed per account; the gallery shows 500 recent available listings plus all of the owner's listings. Disabled users cannot trade, and their offers are hidden until access is restored.

The bank starts with no stock. Purchases from participants add to its inventory. Users cannot buy stickers from the bank; purchases and swaps between participants remain available. When the bank lacks enough coins to buy stickers, it issues the shortfall into its own wallet and records that issuance in the ledger before paying the seller. Historical payments remain in the bank wallet. The gallery shows bank stock, its coin balance and total issuance.

Quantities and balances are integers. A single order offers 1 to 10,000 stickers; an account's coin, star or individual sticker balance is bounded at 2,147,483,647. Listing prices and requested swap quantities have the same integer upper bound. Total lifetime bank issuance is bounded by JavaScript's maximum safe integer. Every adjustment writes an immutable application ledger row. Direct database edits bypass these invariants and should not be used to award currency.

The browser saves an exchange request ID and exact body in session storage before sending. An uncertain result leaves a Retry pending exchange button, which reuses that request even after a reload. Successful and rejected operations refresh current balances. The backend never accepts an owner ID from the request body, rejects reused IDs with changed contents, and checks Origin, CSRF and the account session.

## Backup and recovery

Use the existing tracker service environment when running these commands. Both destinations must be new files outside the public directory:

    node scripts/admin.mjs backup /private/backups/science.sqlite
    node scripts/admin.mjs backup-market /private/backups/market.sqlite

The original backup command remains a scientific-only SQLite backup. The new command backs up only the market database, including its ledger, bank stock and receipts. For a coordinated recovery point, stop all tracker writers before taking both backups. The Fedora deployer's existing stopped-service directory backup includes both databases and their WAL files. Protect both backups; the market still contains account-linked economic activity.

Restore matched backups while the tracker service is stopped. Restoring an old market database alone can lose trades and previously delivered rewards; restoring scientific exports never restores currency. If an operator deliberately restores only a market snapshot, they must reconcile its lost market activity before replaying entitlements. Preserve the current files first. No destructive recovery or currency import is exposed in the browser.

## Verification

Run npm test for unit/API coverage. tests/economy.test.mjs covers reward idempotency, imports, stars, bank supply/stock, demand expiry, escrow, insufficient funds, swaps, authorization, database separation, market outages and replay after a simulated cross-database crash. tests/economy-browser.mjs uses disposable accounts and the actual sprite collection to check real gallery rendering, mobile widths, peer purchases, lost-response retry through reload and shared sign-out.

## Duplicate designs

Market schema version 2 merges duplicate types 13-16 into 1-4 on initialization. Player and bank quantities combine, reward receipts remain unique, and open listings use the original design. Swaps that become a same-design swap are cancelled with escrow returned. Coin and star balances are unchanged. Ledger transfers document the merge; completed trades and request receipts remain intact. Demand includes both historical IDs without counting a trader twice. Old sticker IDs are accepted as aliases on new requests. Duplicate images are excluded from the active collection and public asset allowlist.

## Sale dialog

Choose **Sell this sticker** in your gallery to open the sale dialog with that type selected. Choose the quantity and either sell to the bank, list for coins, or offer a swap. Opening or closing the dialog never submits a transaction. A successful exchange closes it; errors and pending retries stay visible. Bank buying controls have been removed. Older clients receive an explicit rejection for new bank purchases; retries of already completed purchases return the existing receipt without transferring anything again. The standalone selling card has been removed.

Linked external games use the same coin balance through LIDOLLCOIN_API.md. Their grants and operation receipts are in market schema version 3. Game credits are separately recorded as `game credit` ledger entries; the stickerbank issuance counter covers bank-issued coins only. Game tokens cannot access scientific records or spend chart stars.

## Performance bonus policy (operator reference)

New participant sync records use server/performance-bonus.mjs: observations earn
5 coins; wettings earn F=5, SF=10, V=15, SI=20, I=25; diaper changes earn
5 * (1 + wettingsCount), including 5 for a dry change; rolls earn their Hold=5 or
Pee=10 base plus Low=0, Medium=2, High=4, Crisis=6. A missing desperation level
adds zero. Values stay whole numbers; validated wetting counts are 0-10,000.

Participant screens do not list these formulas. Ledger deposits show their true
amount with a randomized cute Performance bonus message, chosen independently
of the classification or desperation level. This is a game reward label, not a
scientific assessment. The policy is not served as a public asset or API config.
Scientific outbox entitlements freeze the first accepted amount. Market schema 8
copies old roll receipts into performance_rewards without crediting again or
rewriting old ledger rows. New market receipts contain only owner, hashed source,
amount and timestamp. Existing records/admin imports only backfill stickers.


## Login bonuses and diamonds

Market schema 9 adds a separate diamond balance and unique daily-bonus receipts. New synced records earn daily attendance bonuses through the durable scientific outbox. Diamonds exchange one-way at 50 coins each using the existing atomic market action/receipt flow. See LOGIN_BONUSES_GUIDE.md.

## New-account starting balance

New Little Log accounts receive **50 lid0llcoins once**, when their authenticated
identity is first created as a tracker participant. The grant appears in wallet
history as **Welcome bonus: 50 lid0llcoins** and is available through the same
wallet API used by MommyBot and games. It does not award stars, diamonds,
stickers or a daily check-in.

Existing tracker accounts retain their balances, including accounts visiting the
market for the first time. Repeat sign-ins, profile renames, imports, spending
coins and service restarts do not grant another starting balance. A shared
identity that has never used Little Log gets its grant when first provisioned in
the tracker.

Account creation and a `registration-coins` reward-outbox entitlement commit in
one science-database transaction. Delivery records a unique owner in the market's
`registration_rewards` table, with its credit and ledger entry in the same market
transaction. Market outages leave the grant pending for retry; replay after a
crash cannot credit it twice. The bank receives no welcome grant, and the grant
does not consume an external application's daily earning allowance.

## Reward limits

New record performance payouts have a 50-coin per-change ceiling and a 250-coin per-account UTC daily budget. Sticker entitlements have a 20-per-day budget; chart stars have a 50-per-day budget. Limits use server time, persist across restarts, and leave scientific data intact. Existing balances and pending entitlements are preserved. Welcome/check-in bonuses use separate policies. Old or zero-award receipts cannot collect again tomorrow. See [SECURITY_ROLLOUT.md](SECURITY_ROLLOUT.md).
