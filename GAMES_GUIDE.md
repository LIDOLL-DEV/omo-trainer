# Games in Little Log

Choose **Games** from the menu. Each card opens a game in a separate tab:

- **Diaper Atelier:** 3 LiDollcoins per roll, a saved collection and shared diaper bank.
- **Cozy Hangman:** 1 LiDollcoin to start; each newly revealed letter position pays 1 coin.
- **Prism Drop:** choose a landing pocket and bet 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 LiDollcoins.
  Exact guesses return 2x the stake, one pocket away returns 1.5x rounded up,
  two away returns the stake, and larger misses return zero. Coin pegs add bonuses
  even on misses. Returns include the stake; replaying a saved drop is free.

Press **Sign in with LiD0llID** on the game page. Anyone with a LiD0llID account
can play; Discord membership is optional. Register if needed and approve wallet
access for game purchases and rewards. An existing LiD0llID browser login can
be reused. Existing Discord-linked players keep their saved collections.

Touhou Trader is no longer listed in the Games menu. `/tracker/games/touhou`
still redirects to the bot so old bookmarks keep working; remove `touhou` from
`server/games.mjs` too if the game itself is retired.

All collections, saved rounds, battle rules and payment recovery remain in
MommyBot. Little Log opens the existing games using the same online wallet.
For a pending Prism Drop payment, use **Retry payment** in the game to settle
the saved drop without charging or rolling again.

Games have separate eight-hour sessions. Signing out of Little Log does not sign
out of an open game. Use each game's Sign out button on shared devices. Unlinking
in Discord invalidates game sessions without deleting collections or balances.
The Games page is available offline; opening games and spending/recovering coins
requires a connection. The games are never embedded in an iframe.

## Operator setup

Deploy the matching MommyBot changes first, then this PWA. After committing and
pushing both repositories, run the existing Fedora updater for MommyBot
(`bash scripts/update-fedora.sh` from its checkout), then:

```bash
sudo bash /opt/lidoll/current/deploy/fedora-update.sh
```

`LIDOLLBOT_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` in the tracker service environment defaults to
`https://bot.lidoll.dev`. Change it only if the bot uses another HTTPS origin;
do not include `/touhou/`, `/auth/` or any other path. Local development permits
HTTP loopback origins outside production. This variable is separate from the
tracker's own `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` and the bot's `LIDOLLID_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`.

The existing `lidollbot` OIDC registration and `/auth/callback` remain in use;
no identity-provider registration change is needed. On the bot's Nginx host,
forward `/auth/`, `/diapers/`, `/hangman/`, `/touhou/` and `/balldrop/` to its existing HTTP
listener. A virtual host that already proxies `/` needs no additional location.
On the tracker host, route `/tracker/games/` to Node with the rest of the app.

`server/games.mjs` redirects only fixed game names to trusted bot login paths.
It forwards no query parameters, tokens or account identifiers. `lib/games.js`
handles offline presentation. The service worker caches the public Games shell
and its module, never game redirects, cookies, API responses or payments. Both
Little Log and Caregiver Tracker themes share the same Games navigation.

Prism Drop uses `/tracker/games/balldrop`, which redirects to the configured
bot origin at `/balldrop/login`. Deploy MommyBot with its balldrop routes before
launching the new card.

Reload the installed PWA after deployment. Verify each card reaches its game,
complete one sign-in with an already linked account and confirm the expected
collection. Unit/browser fixtures cannot verify production
Nginx, Discord membership or the live identity provider.

## Checks

Run `npm test` for the configured-origin and fixed-redirect tests. With local
`PUPPETEER_MODULE` and `CHROME_PATH` set, run `node tests/games-browser.mjs` and
`node tests/theme-browser.mjs` for navigation, both themes, responsive layouts,
preserved form drafts, cached offline navigation and reconnect behavior. They
use disposable data and never spend real coins.


The potty tracker's top-right **Join Discord** link opens https://discord.gg/DBzvxxdvXt in a new tab, including before sign-in.
